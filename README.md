Software Development Life Cycles

To create a program for a customer, it is essential that we understand the user needs. User Stories help with this by allowing us to get feedback from the end user on what they would like to see in a product. The best way to approach the develpment of a product in most cases is to use a heavily Agile Scrum focused approach in order to maximize productivity and collaboration for a team. I like all of the agile principles, as they encourage teamwork and being informed on the project constantly. A good team member is one who participates in all team activities, stays informed on what is going on with the project, and works vigorously toward the goal with the rest of the team.
